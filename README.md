# GP

A simple genetic programming framework I made for educational purposes. The source code is reasonably well documented. The main.py file at the root of this repository contains an example use case for simple regression, which should be enough for figuring out how to use this framework, it's pretty self-explanatory.

This software has not been thoroughly tested, it's not intended for production use. Use [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) instead, it's really good :)

(I disagree with some design decisions I made in this project, reading this code again after a whole year while I write this readme, but I suppose that's a good sign)
